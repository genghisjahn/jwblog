* What's the point?

I was going over what I wanted to talk about in my first blog post on card magic the other night.  I decided to take a break and watch a few card magic videos.  That almost ended magic for me.  I'm watchings these guys and they are all so good.  They are so much better than me and have a multi year or in some cases multi-decdade head starts.  Why bother?  
I mean, I'm a software developer trying to be a project manager at a streaming media company not to mention a husband and a father to 3 kids.  Why bother with card magic at all?  I couldn't think of a good reason to continue.  

But one thing I know about myself is that these kind of defeatest attitude crop up now and then.  The trick is to just sleep it off.  In the morning, I wake up, go about my day and pick up a deck of cards.  Just like I have nearly every single day for the past year.

I have a friend who plays guitar and he says, "Sometimes I listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwiqnJdN1Ug][Mark Knopfler]] and think guitar is the greatest thing ever and I'm glad I play.  Sometimes I hear him and think I should never touch the instrument again, because I'll never make it sound like that."  Same thing I guess.  Just have to wait out the self pity.  Anyhoo, moving on...

* What have I learned in the past year?

You can waste a lot of money buying decks of cards. You'll need a lot of decks but regular ol' Bicycle 808s will do for dang near anything.

Practice every day.  Even if only for a little while.  For me, I have a 20 min train commute into Center City Philadelphia.  If nothing else, I use that time to practice some basic moves or read a book on card magic.  I fit in more time as I am able, and I usually am able to, but when life is hectice, I use those 40 min or so.  At least it keeps me from going backwards.

Be selective about what you learn from.  There's gobs and gobs of card trick tutorials on Youtube.  A lot of it is crap.  I know, I helped make some of the crap.  For now, occsionally, I'll post an unlisted Youtube video on to the cardmagic subreddit, but just to get feedback, not to teach.

People I follow on Youtube are [[https://www.youtube.com/user/MrTricksforfun][Chris Ramsey]], [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Aaysw0-njB9xH8uvNFvvg][Xavier Spade]], [[https://www.youtube.com/user/enduremiller][Justin Miller]],[[https://www.youtube.com/user/DecksAndContests][52Kards]], [[https://www.youtube.com/user/SankeyMagic][Jay Sankey]] and the enigmatic [[https://www.youtube.com/user/DAN1ELmadison][Daniel Madison]].  There are others and I'll post about them in time, but those are the ones I watch the most.

As for books, I highly highly recommend starting with Robert Giobbi's [[http://amzn.to/2k22j9d][Card College Volume 1]].  Almost everyone else will say to start with the [[http://amzn.to/2xEL4zt][Royal Road to Card Magic]].  Royal Road is also great and you should read it, but Card College has incredible diagrams and the language is much easier to understand.  

It's important to augment the videos with book learning.  Lean too much on videos and you'll mimic exactly what you see.  It's hard not to.  But reading will require a little more effort.  You'll wind up learning the move in a way that works for you because the video isn't there to fill in all the blanks.

* You'll get there

Lastly, certain aspects have the appearance of being hard, but they really aren't.  What I mean is, the first time you try to do a Charlier Cut on up to the 50th time you try to do a Charlier Cut, you'll be convinced that it isn't possible.  Your hands just can't do it.  Cards will fall on the floor.  But if you  continue to practice, eventually your hands will comply.  You will improve.
