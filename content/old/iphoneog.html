Just a quick note: &nbsp;I've really gotten into the iPhone photography thing here lately. &nbsp;The good folks at iPhoneography were kind enough to show my stuff in one of their reader showcases. &nbsp;You can find their site <a href="http://www.iphoneography.com/journal/2010/5/12/the-iphoneography-showcase-of-jon-wear.html">here</a>.<br />

I do have lots of software related posts to do, but they take a while to prepare. &nbsp;I'll get back to the main mission soon.
