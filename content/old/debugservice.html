Perhaps this is helpful, perhaps not. &nbsp;I've spent the last 45 min looking over various blog posts and .Net sites trying to find an easy way to debug an NT service. &nbsp;I kept coming across, install the serivce, start it, attached &nbsp;a debugger to a process...etc. &nbsp;I know there is an easy way to do it because I've used it several years ago in .Net 1.1. &nbsp;I gave up searching and went looking through old source code and found it.
