&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are in the wrong major."<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the spring of 1992. &nbsp;I was attending <a href="http://www.lmu.edu/">Loyola&nbsp;Marymount&nbsp;University</a> in Los Angeles and &nbsp;I was sitting in the office of&nbsp;my Human Genetics professor. &nbsp;I&nbsp;had demonstrated some software I had written that simulated the random generation of&nbsp;nucleotides&nbsp;and then told you if any interesting amino acids would form as a result. &nbsp;That may sound impressive but it really wasn't much of a program. &nbsp;It generated some random numbers and told the user if a certain set of numbers occurred. &nbsp;Only instead of showing the user random numbers, the program displayed words like "guanine" and "cytosine" and some other terms that I cannot remember.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway this was in 1992-1993 when it was rare for a non-engineering freshman to have a computer in his dorm room let alone be able to write programs on it. &nbsp;The program was nothing big, just odd, given the circumstances. &nbsp;It wasn't an&nbsp;assignment, I just thought it would be a fun way to implement some of what I had learned in class.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You're a film major?" the professor asked.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes. &nbsp;I've always wanted to be a film maker," I said.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The&nbsp;professor&nbsp;shook her head. &nbsp;"You are in the wrong major."<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course I blew it off. &nbsp;It was flattering that she liked the program but there was no way no how I was going to switch majors away from film. &nbsp;Certainly nothing to do with <i>computers</i>. &nbsp;Film was/is cool. &nbsp;Computers were not cool then and, Apple products aside, they are not cool now. &nbsp;I was finally free of the computer nerd stench that clung to me all through junior high (where I won two programming contests) and&nbsp;high school(where I always did well in science fair by writing software). &nbsp;I was going to be an auteur. &nbsp;Truth be told, I felt like I already was one. &nbsp;Did you see my 8th video project called Tenja the Teenage Ninja? <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But the film career never got going. &nbsp;I decided, for a number of reasons, to drop the film degree but I sure was not going to do anything related to computers. &nbsp;That was for dorks. &nbsp;Did I ever stop writing code though? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;I wrote code for my employers. &nbsp;I wrote code for friends who were still in school (I dropped out of college altogether). &nbsp;The bulk of what I wrote was just for me, just to see if I could make the computer do something. &nbsp;I bought books on PC hardware and software development and read them cover to cover. &nbsp;I eventually ended up working in the tech shop for Best Buy (this was pre-Geek Squad). &nbsp;I worked tech support for Intuit where I finally finagled my way into doing <i>some</i> software development. &nbsp;Five years of unmet expectations had finally gotten through to me. &nbsp;Life had given me a mountain of software development lemons...it was time to make some software development lemonade. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought about this the other day as I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theinksmudge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316017922">Outliers: The Story of Success</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theinksmudge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0316017922" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;by Malcolm Gladwell. &nbsp;He talks a lot about the Rule of 10,000 which says that if a person devotes 10,000 hours or more to a certain interest they will become very, very good at it. &nbsp;I set the book aside, did some quick&nbsp;calculations&nbsp;and realized that I had cleared the 10,000 hours of software development <i>before</i>&nbsp;I ever got paid a dime for doing it. &nbsp;My parents tell stories of my early teenage years where they would be sitting in the den and have a conversation that went something like this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Where's Jon?" asked my mother.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In his room I guess," said my dad.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He's been in there for hours. &nbsp;What's he doing?" asked my mom.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; They got up and knocked on my door. &nbsp;No answer. &nbsp;My dad cracked open the door and there I was sitting in front of my <a href="http://www.web8bits.com/Marcas/Texas_Instruments/English/TI-994A.html">TI 99/4A</a> complete with b/w TV as a monitor, coding a way. &nbsp;I had the headphones on with the&nbsp;<a href="http://deconstructingproductdesign.com/sony-walkman-tps-l2/">Walkman</a>&nbsp;blaring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_22%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dvan%2520halen%2520fair%2520warning%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Ddigital-music%26sprefix%3Dvan%2520halen%2520fair%2520warning&amp;tag=theinksmudge-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Van Halen</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theinksmudge-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W23H8S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theinksmudge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000W23H8S">The Police</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theinksmudge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000W23H8S" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />. &nbsp;My dad would come back around 11:30pm and if I was still awake he would make me go to bed, where I would read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786926813?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theinksmudge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0786926813">Dragonlance Chronicles</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theinksmudge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0786926813" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp; by flash light until I fell asleep around 1am. &nbsp;I nodded off in class a lot.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, I'm thirty six years old now and finally back in school. &nbsp;However, I still haven't decided on a technology related degree. &nbsp;I'm really digging the English courses I'm taking now, but <a href="http://www.ircs.upenn.edu/education/ba-cogsci.shtml">Cognitive Science</a> is looking pretty interesting. &nbsp;It does not really matter since I plan to be in school for a long, long time.<br />
