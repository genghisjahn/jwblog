Last week I wrote a long post about how I use Amazon's Kindle and how freaking great it is. &nbsp;I had all these great little stories and use cases. &nbsp;Then I read over it and&nbsp;decided&nbsp;to scrap the whole thing. &nbsp;Why write about how I use it when you could just try it yourself? &nbsp;So like I said, I chucked that post and wrote this, much shorter one, instead.<br />

You don't have to spend money to get books in the Kindle format. &nbsp;You don't have have to buy a Kindle at all. &nbsp;If you have a Windows PC, Mac, iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Android phone or Blackberry you can get Kindle stuff without buying the device itself. &nbsp;All you need is an Amazon account. &nbsp;Download one of the free software applications for your device and start using Kindle stuff right away. &nbsp;Lots of great classics are free or .99. &nbsp;You can get sample chapters of dang near everything to try before you buy. &nbsp;The built in dictionary is great for when you're reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XF228C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theinksmudge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003XF228C">David Copperfield</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theinksmudge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003XF228C" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;and you come across words like&nbsp;<i>blandishment</i>&nbsp;or <i>scapegrace</i>. &nbsp; You can&nbsp;highlight passages, add notes and they'll sync across all devices. <br />
<br />
Maybe you'll hate reading books in an electronic format. &nbsp;I thought I would. &nbsp;Just try it out. &nbsp;It'll cost you nothing.<br />
<br />
You can download the software free from Amazon&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_lnav_dyn?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200127470">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Once you are set up, here's a sample of some books you can read for free:<br />
