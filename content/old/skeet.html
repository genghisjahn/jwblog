<a href="https://twitter.com/jonskeet" target="_blank">Mr. Skeet</a> doesn't know me and no one that knows me has ever heard me say anything negative about him, so it may seem odd that I'm writing this apology. <br />
<br />
But sometimes, when no one is around, and I'm watching a video from tekpub (<a href="http://tekpub.com/collections/microsoft-and-net/products/csharp4" target="_blank">like one of these</a>), I find myself drumming my fingers and eventually I yell something like this:<br />
<br />
"GET TO THE POINT! &nbsp;<i>I don't care about every last little nuance of the CLR! &nbsp;Who cares if Ildasm looks different for this or that, just tell me about Lambdas! &nbsp;Great Caesar's Ghost! &nbsp;Just stop it already, quit bringing up <a href="https://code.google.com/p/noda-time/" target="_blank">Noda-Time</a> and get to point!</i>".<br />
<br />
Well, I'm trying to make some screen casts of my own and in addition to trying to get the sound to...sound right, I'm realizing that many times you <i>have</i>&nbsp;to go deep into the details or you aren't explaining things properly.<br />
<br />
Take my first stab, <a href="https://vimeo.com/68877072" target="_blank">Getting Started With Dapper</a>. &nbsp;Dapper has been out for a while (most howto posts regarding Dapper are from 2011) so I thought it would be fairly easy to do a screen cast on it. &nbsp;I've used it a lot. &nbsp;I know my way around it. &nbsp;Piece of cake, right?<br />
<br />
Everything was going fine until I realized that I didn't really explain why I put a ToList() on the end of my Dapper.Query&lt;T&gt; calls. &nbsp;The reason, of course, is that I like working with generic lists and .Query&lt;T&gt; returns <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9eekhta0.aspx" target="_blank">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</a>. &nbsp;So I throw on a .ToList() to get things like I want them. &nbsp;But that brings up the question, <i>why</i>&nbsp;<i>does Dapper do that? &nbsp;</i>If I don't explain why IEnumerable is used instead of other collection types, then I'm really doing a screen cast on how I use Dapper rather than what Dapper does. <br />
<br />
So I started writing text for an aside on IEnumerable. &nbsp;I quickly realized this needed to be it's own separate screen cast because when you hit the period after typing .Query&lt;T&gt;("") there are a kah-jillion other&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.aspx" target="_blank">Linq</a> extension methods that pop up:<br />
<br />

I didn't go crazy and spend time on each one, but there are several that need to be discussed. &nbsp;And they behave differently with value types vs. references types and reference types behave differently than <i>nullable</i> reference types and...sheesh. I just wanted to make a screen cast about Dapper and expand the brand a little bit and now I'm looking through the C# specifications!<br />
<br />
I'm taking my time and hopefully making good choices about what needs to be discussed and what can be left out. &nbsp;But, there's more to it than I originally thought.<br />
<br />
And while I can't claim to have walked a mile in Jon Skeet's shoes (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet" target="_blank">his SO score</a> is 576,875 while <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/324586/genghis-jahn" target="_blank">mine is...6</a>), I can say that I've walked, maybe an metaphorical inch in his shoes. &nbsp;After travelling even such a short distance as this, I feel compelled to say to Mr. Skeet, "I'm sorry I yelled at your tekpub video late at night when no one could hear me. &nbsp;I just didn't know."<br />
<br />
Just before I scheduled this post, I went to Mr. Skeet's twitter page and saw this exchange:<br />

<br />
Pretty good advice.
