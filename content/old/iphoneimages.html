I'm experimenting with the iPhone camera and some of the little photo apps that you can get for it. &nbsp;I'm not sure if I'm taking good photographs or not, but I'm having a fun time with it. &nbsp;Hard to believe that it has all these imaging capabilities...and it's a phone too.<br />
<br />
As is my usual MO, I setup a whole other blog devoted to just my iPhone masterpieces. &nbsp;Common sense finally took over and I decided to do just a post about it instead. &nbsp;I may do others and if I'm <i>still</i>&nbsp;into this several months from now then maybe I'll spin off another blog then. <br />
<br />
I've enjoyed working with the limitations of the iPhone. &nbsp;I have to look for places with good lighting or else trick them up some way with the editing software. &nbsp;The&nbsp;constraints&nbsp;are quite liberating so far. &nbsp;Anyway...here they are. &nbsp;I'll keep uploading new images to this Flickr album (<a href="http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photoset.gne?set=72157623979917862&nsid=32202994@N00&lang=en-us"><span class="goog-spellcheck-word" style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">RSS</span></a>):<br />
