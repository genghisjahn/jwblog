How many times have you come across a website and thought, "Hey! &nbsp;I'd like to follow this on Twitter!" but when you looked around for a "Follow Me" button on the website, you can't find one. &nbsp;Not very often right? &nbsp;I mean, most places have a Twitter feed now. &nbsp;But not everyone. &nbsp;So what do you do?<br />
<br />
Well, almost every single website that publishes content on at least a semi-regular basis has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a>. &nbsp;That's your ticket. &nbsp;You can use the RSS feed to create a Twitter feed. &nbsp;Here's how:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Open a <a href="https://twitter.com/signup">new Twitter account</a> and give it a name and a unique email address.</li>
<ul><li>Gmail makes this easy by <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/08/gmail-plus-smart-trick-to-find-block.html">allowing you to add</a> "+somename" to the account part of your email address. &nbsp;So if your gmail address is "myname@gmail.com" you can use the email address "myname+something@gmail.com" and it will still go to your regular Gmail account but you can register it as a unique email address elsewhere.</li>
</ul><li>Open an account at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitterfeed.com/">www.twitterfeed.com</a>.</li>
<li>Click Create A New Feed</li>
<li>Paste in the URL of the RSS feed.</li>
<ul><li>Click Advanced if you want to look through the other options.</li>
</ul><li>Click Next and link the feed to your newly created Twitter account.</li>
<li>Now go back to your REAL twitter account.</li>
<li>Follow the Twitter account you just created.</li>
</ul><div>For instance, I'm&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in player trades and roster changes in the NBA. &nbsp;There is an RSS feed for this but no Twitter feed. &nbsp;At least there was no Twitter feed. &nbsp;Now there is and you can follow it at:</div><div><br />
</div><div><a href="http://www.twitter.com/nbaxact">http://www.twitter.com/nbaxact</a></div><div><br />
