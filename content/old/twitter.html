I was going to write a long post about Twitter and how useful it is.  I've spoken to several people who think it's all celebs and teenagers.  There's a fair amount of that, but there is so much more. Lots of people are using it for very useful purposes. &nbsp;Twitter demographic&nbsp;statistics&nbsp;can be found <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/twitter.com/lifestyle#demographics">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Anyway, like I said, I <i>was</i>&nbsp;going to write a post about Twitter, but the post I wanted to write has already been written by Scott Hanselman. &nbsp;If you aren't on Twitter or don't know much about it, I highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;you <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToTwitterFirstStepsAndATwitterGlossary.aspx">read this post</a>.<br />
