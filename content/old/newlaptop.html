My Dell M1530 went kerput on me for the 2nd time. &nbsp;The first time the <abbr title="hard drive">HDD</abbr> died.  That wasn't so bad because it was still under warranty and Dell sent me a new one.  The second time it went, it was the motherboard.  This time I was out of warranty.  The cost would have been around $500 to replace it so I got an <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Asus+-+Laptop+/+AMD+Turion%26%23153%3B+II+Processor+/+15.6%22+Display+/+6GB+Memory+-+Dark+Gray/1572108.p?id=1218270199430&amp;skuId=1572108">Asus laptop</a> from Best Buy for $550. &nbsp;So far so good. &nbsp;I guess when it comes to laptops, I need to just budget money for a new one every two years. &nbsp;Every single laptop I've owned has gone out with in three years. &nbsp;Gateway, IBM (pre-Lenovo), and two Dells. &nbsp;They usually just sit in a room. &nbsp;They don't get dusty. &nbsp;They don't get too hot. &nbsp;I'm very mindful of them when I travel. &nbsp;My Dell desktop had several problems as well. &nbsp;It still runs but it needs some TLC to stay running. &nbsp;Why am I boring you with all this talk of busted machines? <br />

Well, I used to build custom machines. &nbsp;I say build but really it was assembling about a dozen&nbsp;components&nbsp;inside a case. &nbsp;"Building" sounds cooler, like you are magnetizing each sector of the drive and etching the circuits on the CPU. &nbsp;Anyway, those beige boxes lasted a long time. &nbsp;They lasted for several different customers that kept them in a variety of work spaces and to my&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;none of them ever broken down. &nbsp;I'm not saying I had any great workmanship (I didn't, my wire organization was awful). &nbsp;What I am saying is that the corners that get cut in a large company's assembly line seem to make the difference between real PC longevity and two years of use before the machines goes dark. &nbsp;It's hard to make a profit on a computer. &nbsp;The big PC manufacturers have to make them as cheaply as possible. &nbsp;When you build your own, you build it slower and with (a little) more attention to detail. &nbsp;Most cases these days are spacious enough to have good air flow to keep things from getting too hot inside. &nbsp;That's probably the biggest difference right there. &nbsp;I have a custom machine from 1998 in my basement and when I went down and turned it on, it booted right up to Windows 2000. &nbsp;But enough about desktops.<br />
<br />
I got the new laptop and erased the drive. &nbsp;I made a large Windows 7, <a href="http://www.ntfs.com/">NTFS</a> partition and two partitions that are around 100 GB each. &nbsp;I loaded <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 10</a> on one of those and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora 14</a> on the other (Ubuntu and Fedora are different flavors, <i>distros</i>, of <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>). &nbsp;It took a while to configure each OS and get all the software loaded. &nbsp;I still don't have the Linux partitions like I want them but I know so little about Linux that I'm happy that I got the laptop to triple boot at all. &nbsp;All in good time. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://mozy.com/">Mozy.com</a> has been my backup provider for a while and I have been pleased with them so far. $5 a month for unlimited backup. &nbsp;I bought a 2TB external drive where I'm going to store iTunes data and other files. &nbsp;I'll point Mozy at that and have it back up a few folders on the actual Windows 7 partition. &nbsp;I think I can have the Linux partitions write to a shared location that I can have backed up as well. &nbsp;I'll figure it out.<br />
<br />
That is all for now. &nbsp;I'm not going to do any die rolls for the next several posts because I have some ideas about what I want to write about. &nbsp;Mostly they will have to do with a Microsoft developer learning how to develop on the Linux platform. &nbsp;There will be some writing related posts as well as a recap of my second semester at UPenn. &nbsp;All in good time.
