So I decided to try my hand at screen casting. &nbsp;This is my first effort and I found, as many others have before me, it's not easy getting a screen cast to look anything close to decent. But practice makes...something less bad than before. &nbsp;Anyway, enough with the self depreciation.<br />

This screen cast is a very basic introduction to the Mirco ORM <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/" target="_blank">Dapper</a>. &nbsp;This and the next several screen casts will be targeted towards what I refer to as "default developers". &nbsp;Default developers are developers (like myself a few years ago) who primarily take what Microsoft gives them. &nbsp;If it's not "in the box" or on MSDN, then it's not on the radar. &nbsp;It is not my intention to demean the default developer. &nbsp;Like I said, I used to be one. &nbsp;My intention is to make the material covered as approachable as possible crack open the door to all the great non-Microsoft things that are being done with .Net.</div>

So check out my Dapper video. &nbsp;If you have any suggestions for improvements or think I got something flat out wrong, please let me know in the comments or send an email.</div>
